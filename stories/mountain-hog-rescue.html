                        <p class="lead">**Mountain Hogs** (or warty pigs) are unique but often overlooked members of the wild, playing a crucial role in their mountain ecosystems, especially in tropical forests and grasslands. Their rooting habits help aerate the soil and disperse seeds, contributing to the health and diversity of the vegetation.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, this species faces increasing pressure. The main threats include **competition for habitat** with domestic livestock, **illegal hunting**, and **human encroachment** into their mountain territories. As settlements expand and forests are cleared, the hogs are forced to forage closer to human lands, leading to conflicts.</p>
                        <p>Illegal hunting for bushmeat has led to a sharp decline in populations in some regions. Mountain hogs have a relatively slow reproduction rate compared to other pig species, which makes them particularly vulnerable to this pressure. Every loss of an individual significantly impacts the group's genetic diversity and viability.</p>
                        <p>As part of our project, we are working to protect key mountain hog habitats by establishing guarded corridors that connect fragmented forest patches. We recently rescued a family of four piglets orphaned by hunting. They are now in our care and undergoing preparation for release back into the wild.</p>

                            Many wildlife species that are not 'charismatic megafauna' are vital to ecosystems, and their conservation is critical. The Mountain Hog is one such unsung hero.
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>Our project also includes research aimed at better understanding the migratory paths and nutritional needs of mountain hogs. We provide local communities with alternative, sustainable sources of income to reduce reliance on hunting and mitigate conflicts with wildlife. By supporting this project, you help save a species that is often overlooked but critically important to the mountain forest.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, the conservation of mountain hogs is an investment in the health of the entire mountain ecosystem. We ask for your help in this important and challenging endeavor.</p>
