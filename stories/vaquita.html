                        <p class="lead">Vaquitas are a critically endangered species of marine mammal, native to the
                            northern part of the Gulf of California, Mexico. They are the smallest species of porpoise,
                            reaching only about 4 to 5 feet in length and weighing around 100 to 120 pounds. Despite
                            their small size, vaquitas play an important role in the marine ecosystem, contributing to
                            the balance of the food chain.</p>
                        <p>The primary reason vaquitas are endangered is human activity. The most significant threat to
                            their survival is bycatch, which refers to the accidental capture of non-target species in
                            fishing nets. In particular, vaquitas often become trapped in gillnets, which are used to
                            catch totoaba, a large fish that is also critically endangered. The swim bladders of totoaba
                            are highly prized in illegal international trade, especially in China, where they are
                            believed to have medicinal properties.</p>
                        <p>These gillnets, which are illegal but still used by some fishermen, pose a deadly risk to
                            vaquitas. The nets entangle the porpoises, and because they cannot surface to breathe, they
                            eventually drown. This form of bycatch has had a devastating effect on the vaquita
                            population, with estimates suggesting that fewer than 10 individuals remain in the wild
                            today. Some conservationists fear that the species could go extinct within a few years if
                            these threats are not addressed.</p>
                        <p>Human activity in the region also contributes to the overall environmental degradation that
                            affects vaquitas. Overfishing, habitat loss, and pollution all contribute to the declining
                            health of the Gulf of California, the vaquita’s only known habitat. Invasive species, such
                            as certain types of algae, further threaten the marine ecosystem that the vaquita depends on
                            for food.</p>
                        <blockquote class="border-start border-4 border-accent ps-4 my-4 fst-italic">
                            Despite international efforts to protect the vaquita, including stricter enforcement of
                            fishing bans and the creation of a “zero-tolerance zone” for illegal fishing, progress has
                            been slow. There has been some success in reducing illegal fishing activities, but it
                            remains an ongoing struggle. Efforts to raise awareness about the importance of protecting
                            the vaquita have gained traction, but illegal trade and fishing continue to pose a major
                            threat.
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>In summary, the vaquita’s critically endangered status is largely the result of human
                            activities, primarily illegal fishing for totoaba, which causes bycatch.</p>
                        <p>If the illegal fishing trade persists and conservation efforts are not scaled up, the vaquita
                            may soon become extinct, representing yet another tragic loss of biodiversity due to human
                            influence.</p>
